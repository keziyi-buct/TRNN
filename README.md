The code is divided into two libraries, for TRNN1-1, which is a single-task, single-output model, the relevant code is stored in the folder OpenSA1, and for the multi-task models TRNN M-1, M-M, the relevant code is stored in OpenSA. Running the model ensures that the corresponding folder name is OpenSA to ensure that the path can be read correctly.
